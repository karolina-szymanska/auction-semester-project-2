## Description

An auction site is looking to launch a website where users can add items to be bid on and bid on items other users have put up for auction.
When a new user joins the website, they are given 1000 credits to use on the site. They can get credits by selling items and use credit by buying items. Non-registered users can search through the listings, but only registered users can make bids on listings.

The client has specified the following requirements in the form of User Stories:

- A user with a stud.noroff.no email may register
- A registered user may login
- A registered user may logout
- A registered user may update their avatar
- A registered user may view their total credit
- A registered user may create a Listing with a title, deadline date, media gallery and description
- A registered user may add a Bid to another userâ€™s Listing
- A registered user may view Bids made on a Listing
- An unregistered user may search through Listings
